  "history_content": "In the begining there was the Tagomagic. Aeons after, Tago Mago was born, when its three members heeded the call and decided to act. Soon after, the songs which would comprise their first album were born, channeled from the tagomagish source through the filter of their heads. Birthed in Seville's Sputnik studios, this first effort is a faithful representation of pure Tagomagic. \"Freedom\", their first single, is a good example of it.",
